# apoorvaherle-portfolio
Discover my work in data-driven consulting, tech, and design. From healthcare insights to HCI and product management, my projects showcase a blend of strategic thinking, analytics, and user-focused design. I’m passionate about turning complex data into clear, impactful narratives that drive results.

# About me
Hi! I’m Apoorva Herle (she/her), a student in the Master of Information Systems Management (MISM) program at Carnegie Mellon University. My background spans consulting and data analysis, with experience at firms like ZS and KPMG, where I delved into patient journeys and industry trends. I’m driven by the potential of data to solve real-world problems and make healthcare more efficient and impactful.
Outside of work and studies, I keep busy by singing and boxing, both of which keep me grounded (and energized!).Looking forward to connecting with others who share a passion for tech, data, and maybe even a few offbeat hobbies!

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn more about visualizing data to show my work to the world!
Once I graduate, I plan to leverage these skills in a consulting role, ideally in healthcare or tech. My goal is to contribute to meaningful projects that make a tangible impact, and I’m excited to see how this course will help me grow both technically and strategically toward that path.
