# Outline
For my final project, I’m working on a machine-learning approach to classify tweets about Gender-Based Violence (GBV) into five categories: sexual violence, emotional violence, harmful traditional practices, physical violence, and economic violence. The idea is to shed light on the different forms of GBV and provide a clearer picture of what people are experiencing and sharing online. Many victims find it difficult to speak out due to fear, shame, or social pressure, so analyzing tweets can help amplify their voices and offer data-driven insights for policymakers and support systems.

The project’s story arc starts with an overview of the widespread issue of GBV, especially during times of crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. I’ll then highlight the challenges victims face, including the fear of speaking out and limited knowledge of support options. The main part focuses on using social media data to classify and better understand these experiences while being mindful of the sensitivity of the content. The project wraps up by exploring how these insights can drive real change and support gender equality, influencing policy and resources for those in need.
