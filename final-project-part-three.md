# Changes made since Part II

I incorporated the feedback provided by the professor and TA to refine my presentation and make it more relevant for my peers. One key adjustment was removing references to policymakers,
as the target audience is now focused on students. I simplified the prevention strategies, breaking them down into clear, actionable steps, such as encouraging inclusive conversations, 
addressing harmful behaviors, and providing ways for peers to get involved.

Additionally, I revised the conclusion to include a stronger and more compelling call to action, ensuring the presentation ends with clear, actionable steps that resonate with the 
audience. These changes helped streamline the presentation and make it more accessible and impactful for my peers.
