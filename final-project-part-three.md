# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II

I incorporated the feedback provided by the professor and TA to refine my presentation and make it more relevant for my peers. One key adjustment was removing references to policymakers, as the target audience is now focused on students. I simplified the prevention strategies, breaking them down into clear, actionable steps, such as encouraging inclusive conversations, addressing harmful behaviors, and providing ways for peers to get involved. Additionally, I ensured the charts are more tightly integrated with my story, making the flow better and making the data more relevant and impactful within the context of the story.

Furthermore, I revised the conclusion to include a stronger and more compelling call to action, ensuring the presentation ends with clear, actionable steps that resonate with the students, who were my audience. These changes helped streamline the presentation and make it more accessible and impactful for my peers.

# The audience

My target audience includes fellow students, with the goal of fostering greater awareness and encouraging them to become allies in addressing Gender-Based Violence (GBV). I have observed instances where serious issues of sexual violence were dismissed or brushed off, highlighting the need for deeper understanding and empathy within our community. Many students also hesitate to speak up about GBV due to fear, stigma, or a lack of knowledge on how to address it. Through this project, I wanted to challenge these patterns by raising awareness about the prevalence and impact of GBV, encouraging discussions, and equipping my peers with actionable ways to support survivors and address harmful behaviors. By presenting relatable insights and clear visuals, I hope to inspire students to take GBV seriously, and contribute to creating a safer, more inclusive environment.

# Final design decisions

Since I had a moodboard, I made a conscious effort to keep the colors in the presentation aligned with it, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing aesthetic throughout. I also focused on tying the different charts together, not just in terms of data relevance but also in design (or atleast tried to!), to make them visually consistent and engaging for the audience. To add depth and incorporating the feedback given in Part 2, I utilized multiple datasets and incorporated them into various charts, providing a comprehensive view of the issue. To convey the gravity of the topic, I carefully selected images that highlighted the seriousness of Gender-Based Violence (GBV), aiming to evoke empathy and reflection. Through this process, I feel that I learned the importance of balancing aesthetics, data integrity, and emotional appeal to effectively engage my peers and emphasize the significance of the topic.

# Final thoughts

In reflecting on the process, I realize I would have loved to include details of all the projects I’ve worked on so far in my life to provide a more comprehensive view of my journey. However, I thoroughly enjoyed focusing on the work I did include, as it allowed me to showcase the aspects I’m most passionate about. This experience gave me an opportunity to refine my storytelling skills and make meaningful connections between my work and the audience. Loved the class!
