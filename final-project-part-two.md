# Wireframes / storyboards

The wireframes and storyboards I’ve created outline the key visual and interactive elements for my project on Gender-Based Violence (GBV). They start with a landing page that includes a powerful statistic or quote to immediately draw attention to the issue. From there, I’ve included a timeline to show the challenges victims face, followed by visuals like an interactive heatmap to highlight GBV-related tweets by region, bar charts comparing different categories of violence, and line graphs showing trends over time. The final section uses infographics to show actionable recommendations and a slider to visualize the potential impact of interventions. My goal is to make these visuals clear, accessible, and impactful, helping readers engage with the story and take action.

# User research 

## Target audience

My target audience includes fellow students and researchers who are curious about the intersection of social issues and machine learning. I aim to engage those who are passionate about understanding and addressing GBV, as well as those interested in how technology can provide new perspectives and solutions. Beyond sharing insights, I want my peers to know that it is okay to speak up about difficult topics like Gender-Based Violence. Through this project, I aim to increase awareness, foster empathy, and encourage open conversations around this critical issue. By tailoring the story with clear visuals and relatable insights, I hope to inspire my peers to think critically about how we can leverage technology to drive social change and support those in need.

## Interview script

The purpose of this interview is for me to ensure that the visualizations I’ve created are clear and easy for the audience to understand. I also want to make sure that the message reaches the right audience and effectively communicates the insights I’m trying to share.

| **Goal** | **Questions to Ask** |
| --- | --- |
| To make sure the right message is conveyed | **What message do you think the visualizations convey about Gender-Based Violence (GBV)?** |
| To ensure the categories of GBV are clear | **Can you identify the  categories of GBV from the visualizations?** |
| To make sure the graph can be easily understood | **How easily can you understand the trends or patterns shown in the visualizations?** |
| To evaluate emotional impact | **Do the visualizations make you feel the importance or seriousness of GBV?** |
| To evaluate appropriateness for the target audience | **Who do you think is the intended audience? Do you think these visuals are suitable for them?** |
| To ensure the audience is not overwhelmed or confused | **Do you feel the amount of information presented is too much, too little, or just right?** |
| Identify potential improvements or modifications | **modifications	Is there anything you would change or do differently about the visualizations?** |

 | **What message do you think the visualizations convey about Gender-Based Violence (GBV)?** |
 | That traditional harmful violence has significantly been less as compared to sexual violence. According to the chart sexual violence is alarmingly high as compared to other forms of violence, which means that gender based violence is a serious concern. |  
 The visualization effectively conveys the alarming prevalence of sexual violence among different types of GBV. It highlights how certain categories, like sexual violence, dominate discussions or reports (as represented by tweet counts), while others are comparatively less discussed. | 
 | Sexual violence is the most spoken about kind of violence |


# Moodboards / personas

I am planning to follow this moodboard to further emphasize the idea of this project.
