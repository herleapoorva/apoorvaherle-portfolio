# Wireframes / storyboards

I’ve designed wireframes and storyboards to bring my project on Gender-Based Violence (GBV) to life. It starts with a landing page that grabs attention with a striking statistic or quote about GBV. From there, it leads into a timeline highlighting the challenges victims face. I’ve also included interactive visuals like a heatmap showing GBV-related tweets by region, bar charts comparing different types of violence, and line graphs showing trends over time. To wrap it up, the final section features infographics with actionable recommendations and a slider to show the potential impact of interventions. My aim is to make these visuals engaging, easy to understand, and impactful, so they inspire readers to connect with the issue and take meaningful action.

# User research 

## Target audience

My target audience includes fellow students who are curious about the intersection of social issues and machine learning. I aim to engage those who are passionate about understanding and addressing GBV, as well as those interested in how technology can provide new perspectives and solutions. Beyond sharing insights, I want my peers to know that it is okay to speak up about difficult topics like Gender-Based Violence. Through this project, I aim to increase awareness, foster empathy, and encourage open conversations around this critical issue. By tailoring the story with clear visuals and relatable insights, I hope to inspire my peers to think critically about how we can leverage technology to drive social change and support those in need.

| **What message do you think the visualizations convey about Gender-Based Violence (GBV)?**                      | The visualization effectively conveys the alarming prevalence of sexual violence among different types of GBV. It highlights how certain categories, like sexual violence, dominate discussions or reports, while others are comparatively less discussed.                      | Traditional harmful violence is significantly less compared to sexual violence. Sexual violence is alarmingly high, indicating that GBV is a serious concern.                                                                     | Sexual violence is the most spoken about kind of violence.                                                                                           |
| **Can you identify the categories of GBV from the visualizations?**                                              | Harmful Traditional Practices, Economic Violence, Emotional Violence, Physical Violence, Sexual Violence.                                                                                                                             | All categories are associated with GBV: Harmful Traditional Practices, Economic Violence, Emotional Violence, Physical Violence, and Sexual Violence.                                                                             | Harmful Traditional Practices, Economic Violence, Emotional Violence, Physical Violence, Sexual Violence.                                           |
| **How easily can you understand the trends or patterns shown in the visualizations?**                            | The bar chart is clear and easy to interpret. The significant disparity between counts for sexual violence and other categories makes the trend immediately apparent.                                                                    | The trend shows the alarming rise in sexual violence followed by physical violence compared to traditional violence.                                                                                                               | It is fairly easy to understand the visualization.                                                                                                  |
| **Do the visualizations make you feel the importance or seriousness of GBV?**                                    | Yes, the stark difference in counts, particularly the high number for sexual violence, underscores the seriousness of the issue and calls attention to its widespread nature.                                                           | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Yes, given that over 40K tweets have been shared about GBV, the visualizations instill a sense of seriousness about GBV.                            |
| **Who do you think is the intended audience? Do you think these visuals are suitable for them?**                 | Policymakers, researchers, social activists, or organizations focused on combating GBV. The visuals are suitable for this audience due to their simplicity and ability to draw attention to the most critical issues.                     | The intended audience can be anyone who needs to be educated about the ongoing rate of violence.                                                                                                                                  | Both men and women. The visuals are suitable for both since they spread awareness and seriousness about GBV.                                        |
| **Do you feel the amount of information presented is too much, too little, or just right?**                      | Just right for a high-level overview. However, supplementary details (like demographic breakdowns or geographic trends) could provide deeper insights.                                                                                  | Too little. A few more details on specifics would make the chart clearer.                                                                                                                                                          | A little too less, but almost right.                                                                                                               |
| **Is there anything you would change or do differently about the visualizations?**                               | Add percentages alongside absolute counts for easier comparison. Include annotations or a brief explanation of why sexual violence has the highest count. Use contrasting colors to differentiate categories and make the visualization more engaging. Show trends over time.   | Divide each bar of the bar graph based on gender to understand what category affects which gender more. Otherwise, the graph is enough to convey the alarming increase of sexual violence.                                           | Make the Y-axis description more descriptive, e.g., “Number of Tweets.”                                                                            |

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High prevalence of sexual violence compared to other categories                                             | Emphasize the disparity between categories by including comparative percentages and contextual information about why sexual violence is more prevalent.                   |
| Categories of GBV could be presented more distinctly                                                        | Use different colors or visual indicators to make each category stand out more clearly, ensuring easy identification and comprehension by the audience.                   |
| Visualizations should evoke more emotional impact                                                           | Add short stories or real-life examples alongside the visualizations to increase emotional resonance and highlight the seriousness of the issue.                         |
| Insufficient information for deeper analysis                                                                | Provide additional details, such as demographic and geographic breakdowns, to cater to the needs of policymakers and researchers for a more comprehensive understanding. |
| Need for more descriptive Y-axis labels                                                                     | Update the Y-axis labels to provide more clarity, such as “Number of Tweets” or “Reported Incidents,” ensuring the audience understands the data representation.          |
| Visualizations lack annotations or insights                                                                 | Add annotations or short text insights to explain why sexual violence has the highest counts and include key takeaways directly on the visualizations.                   |
